# WeatherGroupie

Welcome to WeatherGroupie!

This app is designed to recommend music to users by finding songs that are tagged by a range of weather descriptors. 
The app displays the weather and a music track when the user inputs the name of a city. Our team used data from: Open Weather, Last.fm, and Napster.
Styling by UIkit.
